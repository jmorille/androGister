# Wifi Deploy
##############
According to a post on xda-developers, you can enable ADB over WiFi from the device with the commands

setprop service.adb.tcp.port 5555
stop adbd
start adbd
And you can disable it and return ADB to listening on USB with

setprop service.adb.tcp.port -1
stop adbd
start adbd
If you have USB access already, it is even easier to switch to using WiFi. From a command line on the computer that has the device connected via USB, issue the commands

adb tcpip 5555
adb connect 192.168.0.101:5555
To tell the ADB daemon return to listening over USB

adb usb
There are also several apps on the Android Market that automate this process.


# Proxy
##############
$ adb shell am start -a andoid.intent.action.MAIN -n com.android.settings/.ProxySelector

Sinon, il existe une application dans le market pour y acc√©der :
